       " 'chosen': 'It was a sweltering summer evening in New York City, the summer of 1920. A theater festival was taking place in the city, showcasing plays and musicals from all over the country. The festival was a hub of creativity and excitement, with crowds of people pouring in every night to catch the latest performance.\\nBut amidst the glamour and excitement, a grisly murder occurred. A young actress was found dead backstage, her body battered and bruised beyond recognition. The police were called and the theater was quickly shut down, as detectives set out to solve the gruesome crime.\\nEnter our hardboiled detective, Jack Ryan, a grizzled and no-nonsense investigator with a penchant for solving the toughest cases. With his trusty detective agency by his side, Ryan was tasked with getting to the bottom of the murder.\\nRyan arrived at the theater just as the police were finishing up their investigation. The backstage area was a chaotic mess, with actors and production crew members milling about, looking shaken and distraught. Ryan knew he had to act quickly, before the evidence was tampered with or lost.\\n\"Thank you, Officer,\" Ryan said to the uniformed policeman standing guard at the entrance to the backstage area. \"I\\'ll take it from here.\"\\nThe policeman nodded and stepped aside, allowing Ryan to enter the crime scene. As he made his way through the chaos, he noticed a few things that didn\\'t quite add up. For one, the victim\\'s body was in a strange position, almost as if she had been staged. And two, there were no signs of forced entry or struggle, leading Ryan to believe the killer had been someone the victim had known intimately.\\nRyan began by questioning the victim\\'s colleagues and acquaintances. He learned that the victim, a rising star in the theater world, had been in a romantic relationship with a fellow actor, but the actor had denied any involvement in the murder. Ryan also discovered that the victim had been receiving threatening letters, which had been sent to the theater\\'s producer.\\nAs Ryan continued his investigation, he stumbled upon a peculiar clue. In one of the dressing rooms, he found a small journal hidden in a drawer. The journal was filled with cryptic notes and drawings, seemingly random, but Ryan suspected there was more to them.\\nRyan sat down in the dressing room, pouring over the journal, trying to decipher its meaning. It was then he noticed a symbol, etched into the wall above the desk. It looked like a cross with two curved horns on either side, and it seemed to match one of the drawings in the journal.\\nRyan\\'s heart began to race. He knew he was onto something big. He quickly made his way back to his office, where he collected all his notes and evidence, and set out to solve the case.\\nAs the night wore on, Ryan pieced together the evidence, and it became clear that the murder was not just a random act of violence. It was a calculated and premeditated crime, committed by a person with a twisted mind.\\nRyan\\'s final confrontation took place in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. There, he found the killer, a disheveled and disturbed young man, cowering in the corner. Ryan\\'s eyes locked onto the symbol etched into the wall, and he knew he had found his man.\\n\"You,\" Ryan said, his voice low and menacing. \"You\\'re the one who did this. You\\'re the one who etched that symbol into the wall.\"\\nThe killer, overwhelmed, nodded his head in surrender. Ryan handcuffed him and read him his rights, bringing an end to the bloody night at the theater festival.\\nAs the sun rose on a new day, Ryan closed his case file, feeling a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. He had solved the murder, and brought justice to the victim and her loved ones. And he had uncovered a dark and twisted secret, one that would haunt him for years to come.',\n",
       " 'rejected': \"The sound of the busy theater district could be heard in the distance, as the detective made their way through the throngs of people. The air was thick with the scent of popcorn and excitement as the crowds made their way to the theater festival. But as the detective approached, their ears were met with the sound of a woman's piercing scream. As they weaved through the sea of people, they discovered the source of the scream - a dead body lying in the middle of the popcorn-covered floor. The detective had a job cut out for them, as the clues were scarce but pointed towards the possibility of a larger conspiracy. With their sharp wit and deductive reasoning, the detective set out to solve the crime and uncover the truth. But as darkness crept upon the festival, the mystery seemed to deepen, and the detective's resolve was put to the test. Who was the murderer, and what was their motive?

       "'It was a sweltering summer evening in New York City, the summer of 1920. A theater festival was taking place in the city, showcasing plays and musicals from all over the country. The festival was a hub of creativity and excitement, with crowds of people pouring in every night to catch the latest performance.\\nBut amidst the glamour and excitement, a grisly murder occurred. A young actress was found dead backstage, her body battered and bruised beyond recognition. The police were called and the theater was quickly shut down, as detectives set out to solve the gruesome crime.\\nEnter our hardboiled detective, Jack Ryan, a grizzled and no-nonsense investigator with a penchant for solving the toughest cases. With his trusty detective agency by his side, Ryan was tasked with getting to the bottom of the murder.\\nRyan arrived at the theater just as the police were finishing up their investigation. The backstage area was a chaotic mess, with actors and production crew members milling about, looking shaken and distraught. Ryan knew he had to act quickly, before the evidence was tampered with or lost.\\n\"Thank you, Officer,\" Ryan said to the uniformed policeman standing guard at the entrance to the backstage area. \"I\\'ll take it from here.\"\\nThe policeman nodded and stepped aside, allowing Ryan to enter the crime scene. As he made his way through the chaos, he noticed a few things that didn\\'t quite add up. For one, the victim\\'s body was in a strange position, almost as if she had been staged. And two, there were no signs of forced entry or struggle, leading Ryan to believe the killer had been someone the victim had known intimately.\\nRyan began by questioning the victim\\'s colleagues and acquaintances. He learned that the victim, a rising star in the theater world, had been in a romantic relationship with a fellow actor, but the actor had denied any involvement in the murder. Ryan also discovered that the victim had been receiving threatening letters, which had been sent to the theater\\'s producer.\\nAs Ryan continued his investigation, he stumbled upon a peculiar clue. In one of the dressing rooms, he found a small journal hidden in a drawer. The journal was filled with cryptic notes and drawings, seemingly random, but Ryan suspected there was more to them.\\nRyan sat down in the dressing room, pouring over the journal, trying to decipher its meaning. It was then he noticed a symbol, etched into the wall above the desk. It looked like a cross with two curved horns on either side, and it seemed to match one of the drawings in the journal.\\nRyan\\'s heart began to race. He knew he was onto something big. He quickly made his way back to his office, where he collected all his notes and evidence, and set out to solve the case.\\nAs the night wore on, Ryan pieced together the evidence, and it became clear that the murder was not just a random act of violence. It was a calculated and premeditated crime, committed by a person with a twisted mind.\\nRyan\\'s final confrontation took place in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. There, he found the killer, a disheveled and disturbed young man, cowering in the corner. Ryan\\'s eyes locked onto the symbol etched into the wall, and he knew he had found his man.\\n\"You,\" Ryan said, his voice low and menacing. \"You\\'re the one who did this. You\\'re the one who etched that symbol into the wall.\"\\nThe killer, overwhelmed, nodded his head in surrender. Ryan handcuffed him and read him his rights, bringing an end to the bloody night at the theater festival.\\nAs the sun rose on a new day, Ryan closed his case file, feeling a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. He had solved the murder, and brought justice to the victim and her loved ones. And he had uncovered a dark and twisted secret, one that would haunt him for years to come.'"
